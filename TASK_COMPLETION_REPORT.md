### ðŸ§ª Testing Results

The improved PID controller was thoroughly tested:

- âœ… **Basic functionality test** - Proper PID computation
- âœ… **Derivative kick elimination** - No spikes on setpoint changes  
- âœ… **Auto/Manual mode switching** - Smooth transitions
- âœ… **Output limiting and anti-windup** - Proper saturation handling
- âœ… **On-the-fly tuning changes** - Safe parameter updates
- âœ… **Full thermal simulation** - Complete integration test

### ðŸ“Š Simulation Performance

The plots show excellent performance with the improved PID:

- **Temperature Control**: Accurate tracking of discrete setpoints
- **Control Effort**: Smooth, well-behaved heater power output
- **Error Analysis**: Minimal overshoot and good stability
- **All three tuning modes working**: Conservative, Standard, and Aggressive

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

```python
class SimplePID:
    """
    Improved PID Controller based on Brett Beauregard's Guide
    Includes all major improvements: sample time, derivative kick elimination,
    reset windup prevention, auto/manual mode, and proper initialization
    """
